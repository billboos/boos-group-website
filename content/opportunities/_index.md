### Graduate student positions

A position in the Ph.D. program of Berkeley's Department of Earth and Planetary Science will be available in the research group of William Boos, with start date in August 2022.
The student who takes on this position will, over the course of five years and in collaboration with William Boos, produce a body of original research that constitutes a doctoral thesis.
This position is not tied to any particular project, and candidates are encouraged to think broadly and ambitiously about possible thesis topics.
Interested students with strong quantitative backgrounds are encouraged to apply for admission to the [doctoral program](http://eps.berkeley.edu/graduate-students) of the Department of Earth and Planetary Science.
Detailed information on our doctoral program can be found in the [graduate handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L6QZGsDXifje49LTfOKmtAbktOK3771a4iM08t7oPj4/edit?usp=sharing).

This graduate student position includes complete financial support, meaning that tuition, fees, health insurance, and a stipend are all paid while you make satisfactory progress toward the Ph.D. degree.
This typically means that five years of funding are provided.
The Ph.D. qualifying exam must be passed near the end of the second year, and all students are strongly encouraged to serve as a teaching assistant for at least two semesters during the five-year program.
The current stipend is roughly USD 42,000 per year; your tuition, fees, and benefits (including health insurance) amount to about USD 30,000 per year and are additionally paid for.
The financial support for your studies comes in a variety of forms, primarily governmental research grants to the Boos group but also fellowship programs and compensation for teaching assistant duties.

Students who are interested in this opportunity are encouraged to contact Prof. William Boos [by email](mailto:william.boos@berkeley.edu), providing a transcript (unofficial is fine), a brief (e.g. 1-2 paragraph) statement of your research interests, and any other relevant materials you would like to be considered.
Due to the number of inquiries typically received, not all individual requests can be replied to; I strive to respond to prospective students whose applications would be strongly competitive for admission.  Video calls will be arranged with a subset of applicants after applications are reviewed (typically in January and February). 

Berkeley charges an application fee of USD 120 for US citizens and permanent residents, and USD 140 for all others.  Students who cannot afford to pay this application fee can apply for a [fee waiver](https://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/apply/fee-waiver/) if they are a US citizen or permanent resident.
Unfortunately, Berkeley does not offer any formal fee waivers for international students.  However, if you are an international student who cannot afford to pay the application fee, you may upload a single PDF file containing a complete transcript (unofficial is fine), a [personal statement](https://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/apply/personal-statement/), a [statement of purpose](https://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/apply/statement-purpose/), and a cover letter briefly explaining your need for an application fee waiver to [this web portal](https://berkeley.app.box.com/f/c2b9d675604e47b7a8adfd96ae2da428) by December 1, 2020 (two weeks in advance of Berkeley's official application deadline of December 15).
Students whose applications are very strongly competitive will be contacted and asked to provide a full application, including reference letters, by the December 15 deadline, and the application fee will be paid by the Boos research group.

[//]: # ( ### Undergraduate intern:  Research data analyst)

[//]: # ( We are seeking a student intern interested in climate science to analyze large data sets containing observations of rainfall.  The project will investigate the factors that influence rainfall in autumn over multiple densely-populated regions of the tropics by performing statistical analyses on geospatial data, with the aim of developing a seasonal forecasting scheme for this rainfall.  The candidate should have experience working in Python, R, or MATLAB, and some background in data science, statistics, or a related field. Experience with xarray or similar packages for processing netCDF files is preferred but not essential.  The work will be done in collaboration with Prof. William Boos and Dr. Nandini Ramesh, with work done remotely for the foreseeable future.  The position will require approximately 5-10 hours per week of work at a salary of $16.07 per hour.  Candidates should send a CV/resume and a brief statement of interest to both [Prof. William Boos](mailto:william.boos@berkeley.edu) and [Dr. Nandini Ramesh](mailto:nandiniramesh@berkeley.edu).  Applications received by October 23, 2020, will receive full consideration.)

[//]: # (## Postdoctoral scientist)

[//]: # (My group has an opening for a postdoctoral scientist with expertise in using statistical models to understand and/or predict weather and climate.  Candidates from a broad range of backgrounds will be considered (e.g. those coming from the field of statistics with little to no experience in the earth sciences, or vice versa).  The position involves using newly available observations and innovative theoretical frameworks to build statistical models of tropical rainfall, with the goal of advancing understanding and prediction of hydrological variability on a range of time scales.  The exact focus of the work will depend on the candidate's background and interests, but could center on atmospheric vortices and waves in monsoon regions (including Asia, Africa, and the Americas), the extreme rainfall they produce, and perhaps their human impacts. )
