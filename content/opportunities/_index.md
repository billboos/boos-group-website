[//]: # ( **We have finished evaluating and accepting applications for the open Ph.D. student position in the Climate Dynamics group and won’t be admitting more students this cycle. There will be a similar opening next year, with a start date in Fall 2024 and application deadline in late 2023.** )


### Graduate student positions

A position in the Ph.D. program of Berkeley's Department of Earth and Planetary Science will be available in the research group of William Boos, with start date in August 2024.
The student who takes on this position will, over the course of five years and in collaboration with William Boos, produce a body of original research that constitutes a doctoral thesis.
Our group has several focus areas for possible thesis topics, but we also encourage you to bring your own ideas.
Applicants with strong quantitative backgrounds are encouraged to apply for admission to Berkeley's [doctoral program](http://eps.berkeley.edu/graduate-students) in Earth and Planetary Science.

Students in our Ph.D. program must pass the qualifying exam near the end of the second year, and are expected to serve as a teaching assistant for at least two semesters during the five-year program.  Serving as a teaching assistant provides a minimal amount of teaching experience, which is important for many careers, including those in academia.

This graduate student position includes complete financial support, meaning that tuition, fees, health insurance, and a salary are all paid while you make satisfactory progress toward the Ph.D. degree (this typically means that five years of funding are provided).
The salary is currently set to be at least $44,000 per year, with the exact amount determined by the contract between the University of California and the United Auto Workers Union, which our graduate students have joined.
The financial support that we provide for your five years of graduate studies usually exceeds $500,000 and comes from a variety of sources, primarily governmental research grants to the Boos group; fellowship programs and compensation from the university for teaching assistant duties may also contribute.

[//]: # ( Prospective students who are interested in this opportunity are encouraged to contact Prof. William Boos [by email](mailto:william.boos@berkeley.edu), providing a transcript (unofficial is fine), a brief (e.g. 1-2 paragraph) statement of your research interests, and any other relevant materials you would like to be considered.
Due to the number of inquiries typically received, not all individual requests can be replied to; I strive to respond to prospective students whose applications would be strongly competitive for admission.  Video calls will be arranged with a subset of applicants after applications are reviewed (typically in January and February). )

Prospective students who are interested in this opportunity are encouraged to apply to the [EPS Graduate Program](http://eps.berkeley.edu/graduate/admissions) and to send an email to [William Boos](mailto:william.boos@berkeley.edu) to let him know your application is coming.  Video calls will be arranged with a subset of candidates after applications are reviewed (typically in January and February); unfortunately we do not have the capacity to arrange calls with interested prospective students before the application deadline.

Berkeley charges an application fee of USD 135 for US citizens and Permanent Residents, and USD 155 for all others.  Students who cannot afford to pay this application fee can apply for a [fee waiver](https://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/apply/fee-waiver/) if they are a US citizen or Permanent Resident.
Unfortunately, Berkeley does not offer any formal fee waivers for international students.  However, if you are an international student who cannot afford to pay the application fee, you may upload a single PDF file containing a complete transcript (unofficial is fine), a [personal statement](https://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/apply/personal-statement/), a [statement of purpose](https://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/apply/statement-purpose/), and a cover letter briefly explaining your need for an application fee waiver to [this web portal](https://berkeley.app.box.com/f/c2b9d675604e47b7a8adfd96ae2da428) by November 1, 2023 (roughly one month ahead of Berkeley's official application deadline).
Students whose applications are very strongly competitive will be contacted and asked to provide a full application, including reference letters, by the official university deadline, and the application fee will be paid by the Boos research group.

[//]: # ( ### Undergraduate intern:  Research data analyst)

[//]: # ( We are seeking a student intern interested in climate science to analyze large data sets containing observations of rainfall.  The project will investigate the factors that influence rainfall in autumn over multiple densely-populated regions of the tropics by performing statistical analyses on geospatial data, with the aim of developing a seasonal forecasting scheme for this rainfall.  The candidate should have experience working in Python, R, or MATLAB, and some background in data science, statistics, or a related field. Experience with xarray or similar packages for processing netCDF files is preferred but not essential.  The work will be done in collaboration with Prof. William Boos and Dr. Nandini Ramesh, with work done remotely for the foreseeable future.  The position will require approximately 5-10 hours per week of work at a salary of $16.07 per hour.  Candidates should send a CV/resume and a brief statement of interest to both [Prof. William Boos](mailto:william.boos@berkeley.edu) and [Dr. Nandini Ramesh](mailto:nandiniramesh@berkeley.edu).  Applications received by October 23, 2020, will receive full consideration.)

[//]: # (## Postdoctoral scientist)

[//]: # (My group has an opening for a postdoctoral scientist with expertise in using statistical models to understand and/or predict weather and climate.  Candidates from a broad range of backgrounds will be considered (e.g. those coming from the field of statistics with little to no experience in the earth sciences, or vice versa).  The position involves using newly available observations and innovative theoretical frameworks to build statistical models of tropical rainfall, with the goal of advancing understanding and prediction of hydrological variability on a range of time scales.  The exact focus of the work will depend on the candidate's background and interests, but could center on atmospheric vortices and waves in monsoon regions (including Asia, Africa, and the Americas), the extreme rainfall they produce, and perhaps their human impacts. )
