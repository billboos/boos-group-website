abstract: Future changes in the North American monsoon, a circulation system
  that brings abundant summer rains to vast areas of the North American
  Southwest, could have significant consequences for regional water resources.
  How this monsoon will change with increasing greenhouse gases, however,
  remains unclear, not least because coarse horizontal resolution and systematic
  sea-surface temperature biases limit the reliability of its numerical model
  simulations. Here we investigate the monsoon response to increased atmospheric
  carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) concentrations using a 50-km-resolution global climate
  model which features a realistic representation of the monsoon and its
  synoptic-scale variability. It is found that the monsoon response to CO$_2$
  doubling is sensitive to sea-surface temperature biases. When minimizing these
  biases, the model projects a robust reduction in monsoonal precipitation over
  the southwestern United States, contrasting with previous multi-model
  assessments. Most of this precipitation decline can be attributed to increased
  atmospheric stability, and hence weakened convection, caused by uniform
  sea-surface warming. These results suggest improved adaptation measures,
  particularly water resource planning, will be required to cope with projected
  reductions in monsoon rainfall in the American Southwest.
