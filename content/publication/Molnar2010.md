abstract: Prevailing opinion assigns the Tibetan Plateau a crucial role in
  shaping Asian climate, primarily by heating of the atmosphere over Tibet
  during spring and summer. Accordingly, the growth of the plateau in geologic
  time should have written a signature on Asian paleoclimate. Recent work on
  Asian climate, however, challenges some of these views. The high Tibetan
  Plateau may affect the South Asian monsoon less by heating the overlying
  atmosphere than by simply acting as an obstacle to southward flow of cool, dry
  air. The East Asian “monsoon” seems to share little in common with most
  monsoons, and its dynamics may be affected most by Tibet’s lying in the path
  of the subtropical jet stream. Although the growing plateau surely altered
  Asian climate during Cenozoic time, the emerging view of its role in
  present-day climate opens new challenges for interpreting observations of both
  paleoclimate and modern climate.
