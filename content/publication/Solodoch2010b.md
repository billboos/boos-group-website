abstract: A mechanism is presented, based on multiscale interactions via
  nonlinear wind-induced surface heat exchange (WISHE), that produces
  eastward-propagating, intraseasonal convective anomalies in the tropical
  atmosphere. Simulations of convectively coupled disturbances are presented in
  two intermediate-complexity atmospheric models. One is a shallow water model
  with a simple WISHE-motivated heating term. The other model is also based on a
  first baroclinic mode but has an additional prognostic equation for humidity
  and a simple representation of moist convection based on a quasi-equilibrium
  approximation. In spite of many differences between the models, they robustly
  produce a coherent signal in westerly winds and convection that travels
  eastward at 4–10 m s$^{-1}$. It is shown here that this slow signal is a
  forced response to an eastward-propagating Yanai (mixed Rossby–gravity) wave
  group. The response takes the form of a forced Kelvin wave that is driven
  nonlinearly, via WISHE, by meridional wind anomalies of the Yanai wave group
  and that travels considerably more slowly than the free convectively coupled
  Kelvin waves in these models. The Yanai waves are destabilized in the models
  used here by WISHE in the presence of mean easterlies, but more generally they
  could also be excited by stratiform instability in the absence of mean
  easterlies so that the mechanism described here could also operate without
  mean easterlies. Similarities to and differences from the Madden–Julian
  oscillation (MJO) and convectively coupled tropical waves are discussed.

abstract_short: The intraseasonal Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) involves a
  slow eastward-propagating signal in the tropical atmosphere which
  significantly influences climate yet is not well understood despite
  significant theoretical and observational progress. We study the atmosphere's
  response to nonlinear "Wind Induced Surface Heat Exchange" (WISHE) forcing in
  the tropics using a simple shallow water atmospheric model. The model produces
  an interestingly rich interannual behavior including a slow, eastward
  propagating equatorial westerly multiscale signal, not consistent with any
  free linear waves, and with MJO-like characteristics. It is shown that the
  slow signal is due to a Kelvin wave forced by WISHE due to the meridional wind
  induced by a Yanai wave group. The forced Kelvin wave has a velocity similar
  to the group velocity of the Yanai waves, allowing the two to interact
  nonlinearly via the WISHE term while slowly propagating eastward. These
  results may have implications for observed tropical WISHE-related atmospheric
  intraseasonal phenomena.
