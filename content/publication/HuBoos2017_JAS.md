title = "The physics of orographic elevated heating in radiative-convective equilibrium"
abstract = "Elevated heating of the atmosphere by large plateaus has been argued to influence regional climate in Asia and other regions, but the mechanisms that cause the troposphere to equilibrate at warmer temperatures over elevated terrain are not well understood. This paper quantitatively describes the physics that controls temperatures over elevated terrain in radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE). First, a cloud system-resolving model (CSRM) is used to simulate RCE states over surfaces with various elevations. Then a theory for the influence of surface elevation on temperatures in RCE is presented. Together with offline radiative transfer calculations, this theory is used to quantitatively attribute the magnitude of the elevated heating effect to top-of-atmosphere radiative flux changes caused by decreases in longwave absorption, shortwave scattering, and the moist lapse rate that occur as surface pressure drops. Sensitivity functions obtained through these offline calculations suggest that elevated heating is weaker in warmer climates, and additional CSRM simulations support this hypothesis. Under certain circumstances, even the sign of the elevated heating effect can change to produce cooler temperatures at a given pressure-level as the surface is lifted in RCE."
