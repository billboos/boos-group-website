abstract: Volcanic eruptions provide tests of human and natural system
  sensitivity to abrupt shocks because their repeated occurrence allows the
  identification of systematic relationships in the presence of random
  variability. Here we show a suppression of Nile summer flooding via the
  radiative and dynamical impacts of explosive volcanism on the African monsoon,
  using climate model output, ice-core-based volcanic forcing data, Nilometer
  measurements, and ancient Egyptian writings. We then examine the response of
  Ptolemaic Egypt (305–30 BCE), one of the best-documented ancient superpowers,
  to volcanically induced Nile suppression. Eruptions are associated with revolt
  onset against elite rule, and the cessation of Ptolemaic state warfare with
  their great rival, the Seleukid Empire. Eruptions are also followed by
  socioeconomic stress with increased hereditary land sales, and the issuance of
  priestly decrees to reinforce elite authority. Ptolemaic vulnerability to
  volcanic eruptions offers a caution for all monsoon-dependent agricultural
  regions, presently including 70% of world population.
