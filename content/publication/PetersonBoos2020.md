abstract: Radiative feedbacks are known to strongly modify horizontal shifts of
  the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) produced by remote atmospheric
  energy sources. This study uses a one-dimensional moist energy balance model
  to understand how radiative feedbacks and the structure of an imposed eddy
  diffusivity can influence such ITCZ shifts. The Planck feedback is shown to
  damp ITCZ shifts more strongly for extratropical forcings than for tropical
  ones, because lower moisture content in cold regions makes the temperature
  response larger there. The water vapor feedback on ITCZ shifts is shown to be
  dominated by changes in the cross-equatorial asymmetry of the relative
  humidity of subtropical dry zones, with additional contributions by the
  changes in mixing ratio that occur at fixed relative humidity and by the
  meridional shift of the humid ITCZ. Finally, the ITCZ response is found to be
  highly sensitive to the meridional structure of the diffusivity; the ITCZ
  shift increases with the tropical diffusivity, even when the global mean
  diffusivity is fixed.
