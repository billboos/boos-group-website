abstract: An idealized three-dimensional model of buoyancy-forced flow in a
  single hemisphere is used to investigate whether transient diapycnal mixing
  can sustain the meridional overturning circulation. In the annual mean, mixing
  transience had little effect on the meridional overturning. When mixing
  occurred on basin boundaries, the overturning strength was found to be
  insensitive to mixing transience. For mixing that was highly localized in
  space away from basin boundaries, oceanic meridional mass and heat transport
  decreased as mixing became more transient. The increased sensitivity in the
  highly localized case is likely due to the inhibition of surface heat flux
  into the thermocline. The dynamic response to transient mixing featured
  large-scale, internal oscillations that increased in amplitude with the
  transience of mixing but were confined to the Tropics and had little effect on
  the overturning cell through midlatitudes. These results indicate that
  transient diapycnal mixing, with a distribution suggestive of tropical
  cyclones, can effectively drive a meridional overturning.
