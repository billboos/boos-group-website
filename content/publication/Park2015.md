abstract: The strengthening of monsoonal southerlies over East Asia is
  associated with the westward intensification of the North Pacific subtropical
  high. Previous work has shown that the seasonal-mean position and strength of
  subtropical highs are affected by tropical and subtropical diabatic heating.
  Here it is shown that the synoptic-time-scale strengthening of southerlies
  over eastern China is dynamically tied to extratropical eddy activity.
  Composite analysis based on strong southerly wind events highlights an
  antecedent baroclinic wave train propagating southeastward into eastern China
  from extratropical central Asia. This wave train generates quasigeostrophic
  ascent over eastern China that is associated with heavy precipitation. The
  anomalously cold upper-tropospheric conditions associated with the wave train
  decrease static stability throughout the lower and middle troposphere in
  eastern China, while low-level moistening enhances equivalent potential
  temperature. It is proposed that the resulting reductions in dry and moist
  static stability intensify the eddy-induced precipitating ascent. These
  results illustrate how East Asian monsoon circulation and precipitation can be
  enhanced by the interaction of midlatitude baroclinic waves with the moist
  subtropical monsoon region.
