abstract: Oceans are well-known to be directly altered by global climate forcings such as greenhouse gas changes,
  but how oceans are indirectly influenced by land and its response to such forcings remains less explored. Here, 
  we assess the present-day and projected future state of a little-explored feature of the climate system -- a “land
  wake” in relative humidity downwind of the east coast of North America, consisting of low-humidity continental
  air extending roughly 1,000 km over the Atlantic ocean. The wake exists throughout the year, but is supported by
  high continental temperatures in summer and low continental moisture in winter. The wake is well represented in 
  an ensemble of global climate models (GCMs), qualitatively matching reanalysis data. Under increasing atmospheric 
  CO2, the land wake intensifies in GCM simulations through two pathways: the radiative effects of CO2 on surface
  temperatures, and the biogeochemical effect of CO2 on terrestrial vegetation. Vegetation responses to increased
  CO2 alter the summer wake from Florida to Newfoundland, and both the radiative and biogeochemical effects of CO2
  drive reductions in coastal cloud cover. These changes illustrate the potential of rapidly changing terrestrial
  climate to influence coastal regions and the ocean environment downwind of continents through both light conditions
  and the energy balance of the surface ocean.
