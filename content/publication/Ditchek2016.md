abstract: "Synoptic-scale monsoon disturbances produce the majority of
  continental rainfall in the monsoon regions of South Asia and Australia, yet
  there is little understanding of the conditions that foster development of
  these low pressure systems. Here a genesis index is used to associate monsoon
  disturbance genesis in a global domain with monthly mean, climatological
  environmental variables. This monsoon disturbance genesis index (MDGI) is
  based on four objectively selected variables: Total column water vapor,
  low-level absolute vorticity, an approximate measure of convective available
  potential energy, and midtropospheric relative humidity. A Poisson regression
  is used to estimate the index coefficients. Unlike existing tropical cyclone
  genesis indices, the MDGI is defined over both land and ocean, consistent with
  the fact that monsoon disturbance genesis can occur over land. The index
  coefficients change little from their global values when estimated separately
  for the Asian-Australian monsoon region or the Indian monsoon region,
  suggesting that the conditions favorable for monsoon disturbance genesis, and
  perhaps the dynamics of genesis itself, are common across multiple monsoon
  regions. Vertical wind shear is f ound to be a useful predictor in some
  regional subdomains; although previous studies suggested that baroclinicity
  may foster monsoon disturbance genesis, here genesis frequency is shown to be
  reduced in regions of strong climatological vertical shear. The coefficients
  of the MDGI suggest that monsoon disturbance genesis is fostered by humid,
  convectively unstable environments that are rich in vorticity. Similarities
  with indices used to describe the distribution of tropical cyclone genesis are
  discussed."
