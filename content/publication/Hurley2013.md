abstract: "The interannual variability of monsoon precipitation is described in
  the context of a convective quasi-equilibrium framework. Using two reanalysis
  products and two global precipitation datasets, the authors examine linear
  relationships between seasonal anomalies of precipitation and subcloud
  equivalent potential temperature ($\\theta_{eb}$) local to six monsoon
  regions. This approach provides a single near-surface thermodynamically
  relevant variable over both land and ocean, extending previous studies of
  interannual monsoon variability that emphasized ocean surface temperatures.
  After removing the variability linearly associated with an index of the El
  Ni{ñ}o-Southern Oscillation, positive monsoon precipitation anomalies are
  shown to be associated with enhanced $\\theta_{eb}$ local to and slightly
  poleward of the climatological $\\theta_{eb}$ maximum. The variations in
  continental $\\theta_{eb}$ local to the monsoon precipitation maxima are
  mainly due to variations in subcloud specific humidity, with changes in
  subcloud temperature having the opposite sign. Motivated by the fact that some
  of these subcloud humidity anomalies occur over deserts poleward of monsoon
  regions, the relationship of 700-hPa flow with precipitation is examined, and
  enhanced precipitation in several regions is found to covary with the
  properties of shallow meridional circulations. The implications of these
  results for the understanding of monsoon interannual variability are
  discussed. "

abstract_short: The interannual variability of monsoon precipitation is
  described in the context of a convective quasi-equilibrium framework. Using
  two reanalysis products and two global precipitation datasets, the authors
  examine linear relationships between seasonal anomalies of precipitation and
  subcloud equivalent potential temperature ($	heta$ eb ) local to six monsoon
  regions. This approach provides a single near-surface thermodynamically
  relevant variable over both land and ocean, extending previous studies of
  interannual monsoon variability that emphasized ocean surface temperatures.
  After removing the variability linearly associated with an index of the El
  Ni{ñ}o-Southern Oscillation, positive monsoon precipitation anomalies are
  shown to be associated with enhanced $	heta$ eb local to and slightly poleward
  of the climatological $	heta$ eb maximum. The variations in continental
  $	heta$ eb local to the monsoon precipitation maxima are mainly due to
  variations in subcloud specific humidity, with changes in subcloud temperature
  having the opposite sign. Motivated by the fact that some of these subcloud
  humidity anomalies occur over deserts poleward of monsoon regions, the
  relationship of 700-hPa flow with precipitation is examined, and enhanced
  precipitation in several regions is found to covary with the properties of
  shallow meridional circulations. The implications of these results for the
  understanding of monsoon interannual variability are discussed.
