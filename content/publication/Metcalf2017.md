abstract: Climate change is likely to profoundly modulate the burden of
  infectious diseases. However, attributing health impacts to a changing climate
  requires being able to associate changes in infectious disease incidence with
  the poten- tially complex influences of climate. This aim is further
  complicated by nonlinear feedbacks inherent in the dynamics of many
  infections, driven by the processes of immunity and transmission. Here, we
  detail the mechan- isms by which climate drivers can shape infectious disease
  incidence, from direct effects on vector life history to indirect effects on
  human susceptibility, and detail the scope of variation available with which
  to probe these mechan- isms. We review approaches used to evaluate and
  quantify associations between climate and infectious disease incidence,
  discuss the array of data available to tackle this question, and detail
  remaining challenges in under- standing the implications of climate change for
  infectious disease incidence. We point to areas where synthesis between
  approaches used in climate science and infectious disease biology provide
  potential for progress.
