abstract: The North American monsoon is frequently affected by transient,
  propagating upper tropospheric vorticity anomalies.  Sometimes called Tropical
  Upper-Tropospheric Troughs (TUTTs), these features have been claimed to
  episodically enhance monsoon rainfall.  Here we track long-lived TUTTs in 40
  years of reanalysis data, producing composites and case studies from 340 TUTTs
  which last, on average, seven days as they move westward across the North
  American monsoon region.  TUTTs are thought to form from midlatitude Rossby
  wave breaking; case studies from our dataset support this theory.  TUTTs move
  westward within the easterly upper-level flow in which they are embedded.  In
  vortex-centered composites along the full tracks of long-lived TUTTs, we find
  no detectable increase in rainfall within the main TUTT circulation.  Instead,
  negative precipitation anomalies lie within about 500 km of the TUTT
  center.  Quasi-geostrophic ascent occurs in the southeast quadrant of TUTTs
  but is confined to the upper troposphere and does not appear to interact with
  precipitation.  Positive anomalies of ascent and rainfall occur south and
  southeast of TUTTs but lie outside the main TUTT vortex, perhaps indicating
  concurrent variations in nearby climatological precipitation maxima. In
  contrast with previous case studies and subjective analyses that showed TUTTs
  enhance precipitation in parts of northwestern Mexico, our composites along
  the tracks of long-lived TUTTs portray these systems, to first order, as
  strong vorticity anomalies trapped in the upper troposphere that interact only
  weakly and indirectly with precipitation.
