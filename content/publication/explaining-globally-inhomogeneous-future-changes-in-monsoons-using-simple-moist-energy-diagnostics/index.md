abstract: This study examines the annual cycle of monsoon precipitation
  simulated by models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6
  (CMIP6), then uses moist energy diagnostics to explain globally inhomogeneous
  projected future changes. Rainy season characteristics are quantified using a
  consistent method across the globe. Model bias is shown to include rainy
  season onsets tens of days later than observed in some monsoon regions (India,
  Australia, and North America) and overly large summer precipitation in others
  (North America, West Africa, South America, and southern Africa). Projected
  next-century changes include rainy season lengthening in the two largest
  Northern Hemisphere monsoon regions (South Asia and eastern Sahel) and
  shortening in the two largest Southern Hemisphere regions (South America and
  southern Africa).  Changes in the North American and Australian monsoons are
  less coherent across models. To understand these changes, relative moist
  static energy (MSE) is defined as the difference between local and
  tropical-mean surface air MSE. Future changes in relative MSE in each region
  correlate well with onset and demise date changes. Furthermore, Southern
  Hemisphere regions projected to undergo rainy season shortening are spanned by
  an increasing equator-to-pole MSE gradient, suggesting their rainfall will be
  increasingly inhibited by fluxes of dry extratropical air; Northern Hemisphere
  regions with projected lengthening of rainy seasons undergo little change in
  equator-to-pole MSE gradient. Thus, although model biases raise questions on
  the reliability of some projections, these results suggest that globally
  inhomogeneous future changes in monsoon timing may be understood through
  simple measures of surface air MSE.
