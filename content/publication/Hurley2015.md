abstract: The first global climatology of monsoon low-pressure systems is
  presented here, based on the ERA-Interim reanalysis. Low-pressure systems are
  classified into three intensity categories and particular focus is given to
  systems in the category corresponding to a traditional definition of monsoon
  depressions. Vortex tracks are identified using an automated algorithm applied
  to the distributions of 850 hPa relative vorticity, sea-level pressure and
  surface wind speed for 1979-2012. Roughly two to three times as many monsoon
  low-pressure systems form in the Northern Hemisphere as in the Southern
  Hemisphere during local summer. The frequency of genesis typically peaks in
  local summer, but low-pressure systems form throughout the year in every
  monsoon region. Interannual variability is weak, with standard deviations of
  summer counts typically being below 10{%} of the long-term summer mean.
  Regional composites reveal that monsoon depressions in India, the western
  Pacific and northern Australia share a common structure, consisting of a
  warm-over-cold core and a top-heavy column of potential vorticity that extends
  from the surface to the upper troposphere. A separate class of monsoon
  low-pressure systems develops over dry regions of West Africa and western
  Australia, with a shallow composite structure having a warm core in the lower
  troposphere and cyclonic potential vorticity confined to a thin near-surface
  layer. Low-pressure systems in nearly all monsoon regions are estimated to
  account for a large fraction, from about 40% to more than 80%, of summer
  precipitation on the poleward edge of the climatological mean precipitation
  maxima.
