abstract: Internal gravity waves influence a variety of phenomena in Earth's
  stratosphere and upper troposphere, including aviation weather turbulence and
  circulations that set high-altitude distributions of ozone and greenhouse
  gases. Here coupling between the dominant mode of subseasonal variability of
  the equatorial atmosphere - the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) - and
  subtropical stratospheric gravity waves created by flow over topography is
  documented for the first time. We use three different meteorological data sets
  to show that during boreal winter, the MJO modifies the vertical distribution
  of internal gravity wave drag induced by the Tibetan Plateau and the
  deposition of momentum into the stratosphere. This interaction, however, has
  no significant impact on the vertically integrated wave drag. Our findings
  raise new questions about how future changes in tropical rainfall might affect
  stratospheric variability and highlight the importance of local processes over
  Tibet for the circulations that set distributions of climatically important
  high-altitude trace gases.
