abstract: Elevated heating by the Tibetan Plateau was long thought to drive the
  South Asian summer monsoon, but recent work showed this monsoon was largely
  unaffected by removal of the plateau in a climate model, provided the narrow
  orography of adjacent mountain ranges was preserved. There is debate about
  whether those mountain ranges generate a strong monsoon by insulating the
  thermal maximum from cold and dry extratropical air or by providing a source
  of elevated heating. Here we show that the strength of the monsoon in a
  climate model is more sensitive to changes in surface heat fluxes from
  non-elevated parts of India than it is to changes in heat fluxes from adjacent
  elevated terrain. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that orography
  creates a strong monsoon by serving as a thermal insulator, and suggests that
  monsoons respond most strongly to heat sources coincident with the thermal
  maximum.
