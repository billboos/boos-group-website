abstract: "Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are extreme weather events that can alleviate drought or cause billions of dollars in flood damage. By transporting significant amounts of latent energy towards the poles, they are crucial to maintaining the climate systemâ€™s energy balance. Since there is no first-principles definition of an AR grounded in geophysical fluid mechanics, AR identification is currently performed by a multitude of expert-defined, threshold-based algorithms. The variety of AR detection algorithms has introduced uncertainty into the study of ARs, and the algorithms' thresholds may not generalize to new climate datasets and resolutions. We train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect ARs while representing this uncertainty; we name these models ARCNNs."
