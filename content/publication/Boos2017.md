abstract: Indian monsoon depressions are synoptic-scale storms that form
  primarily over the Bay of Bengal and propagate westward over the subcontinent,
  producing a large fraction of India's total summer precipitation. We recently
  showed that, contrary to long-standing ideas, the westward propagation of
  Indian monsoon depressions is accomplished primarily by horizontal adiabatic
  advection of potential vorticity (PV), not by vortex stretching or diabatic PV
  generation that occurs in the region of quasi-geostrophic ascent southwest of
  the vortex center. This chapter extends that work by using several reanalysis
  products to examine case studies of Indian monsoon depressions. In all
  reanalyses examined, monsoon depressions have maximum PV in the middle
  troposphere, at higher altitudes than the level of maximum relative vorticity.
  The horizontal structure of mid-tropospheric PV suggests that the axial
  asymmetry of the vortex that produces the nonlinear westward advection may
  result at least partly from diabatic heating. Thus, although storm motion is
  produced primarily by horizontal adiabatic advection, diabatic heating can
  play an indirect role by shaping the PV field that produces this advection.
