abstract: An envelope of convection that propagates both poleward and eastward
  accounts for the largest fraction of intraseasonal variance of the tropical
  atmosphere during boreal summer. Here the mechanisms of poleward propagating
  convective anomalies are examined in a nonhydrostatic model with zonally
  symmetric boundary conditions, integrated on a beta plane at resolutions high
  enough to explicitly represent moist convection. When the domain has a narrow
  zonal dimension of 100 km or less, the model produces a quasisteady
  intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). Meridionally propagating transients are
  produced for some prescribed sea surface temperature distributions, but these
  transients are shallow, vanish at finer resolutions, and have a structure that
  bears little resemblance to that of observed poleward propagating anomalies.
  This is in sharp contrast to previous studies that obtained robust poleward
  propagating anomalies in axisymmetric models using parameterized moist
  convection, and it suggests that the anomalies seen in those models may be
  caused by deficient representations of dynamics or subgrid-scale physics.
  Robust poleward propagating anomalies are obtained when the high-resolution,
  nonhydrostatic model is integrated in a wider domain with a zonal dimension
  near 1000 km. Diagnostics suggest that poleward propagation in this wide
  domain results from the convectively coupled beta drift of low-level vorticity
  anomalies. Deep near-equatorial ascent produces low-level cyclones that
  migrate poleward through the process of beta drift; Ekman pumping in these
  drifting cyclones then humidifies the free troposphere ahead of the initial
  deep ascent, shifting the convection poleward. The moist static energy budget
  and model sensitivity tests suggest that these anomalies can be viewed as
  moisture modes destabilized through a moisture–radiation feedback.
  Wind–evaporation feedback also seems to contribute to the instability of these
  anomalies, but because it enhances surface fluxes on the equatorward side of
  the anomalies, it also reduces their propagation speed. These results suggest
  a novel mechanism for the poleward propagation of intraseasonal convective
  anomalies and illustrate the need to evaluate theoretical models that use
  parameterized convection against cloud system–resolving models.
