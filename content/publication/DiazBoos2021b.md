abstract: "This study explores the effect of surface sensible and latent heat
  fluxes on monsoon depressions using a series of idealized
  convection-permitting simulations. Each experiment is initialized with a small
  amplitude wave that is allowed to grow within an environment representative of
  the South Asian monsoon. Comparing experiments with and without interactive
  surface heat fluxes, it is found that these fluxes enhance the growth of the
  simulated vortices. Without interactive surface fluxes, the strengthening
  period is short and the vortices fail to reach intensities characteristic of
  stronger monsoon depressions. Using a large set of experiments in which the
  vertical and meridional shear are systematically varied, it is found that
  surface heat fluxes enhance intensity the most when upper-level shear is weak,
  the low-level shear and associated moist static energy gradient are
  sufficiently steep, and the meridional shear is strong. These experiments
  reveal two different regimes of monsoon depression growth: one in which
  convection is driven by moist static energy (MSE) advection and one in which
  it is driven by surface heat fluxes and quasi-geostrophic forcing for ascent.
  Both regimes require sufficiently strong meridional shear to achieve initial
  growth by barotropic instability."
