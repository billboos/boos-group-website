abstract: Changes in land surface albedo and land surface evaporation modulate
  the atmospheric energy budget by changing temperatures, water vapor, clouds,
  snow and ice cover, and the partitioning of surface energy fluxes. Here
  idealized perturbations to land surface properties are imposed in a global
  model to understand how such forcings drive shifts in zonal mean atmospheric
  energy transport and zonal mean tropical precipitation. For a uniform decrease
  in global land albedo, the albedo forcing and a positive water vapor feedback
  contribute roughly equally to increased energy absorption at the top of the
  atmosphere (TOA), while radiative changes due to the temperature and cloud
  cover response provide a negative feedback and energy loss at TOA. Decreasing
  land albedo causes a northwards shift in the zonal mean intertropical
  convergence zone (ITCZ). The combined effects on ITCZ location of all
  atmospheric feedbacks roughly cancel for the albedo forcing; the total ITCZ
  shift is comparable to that predicted for the albedo forcing alone. For an
  imposed increase in evaporative resistance that reduces land evaporation, low
  cloud cover decreases in the northern mid-latitudes and more energy is
  absorbed at TOA there; longwave loss due to warming provides a negative
  feedback on the TOA energy balance and ITCZ shift. Imposed changes in land
  albedo and evaporative resistance modulate fundamentally different aspects of
  the surface energy budget. However, the pattern of TOA radiation changes due
  to the water vapor and air temperature responses are highly correlated for
  these two forcings because both forcings lead to near-surface warming.
