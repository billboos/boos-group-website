Our group’s research focuses on Earth’s tropical climate. We work on a range of problems involving atmosphere-ocean dynamics, land surface processes, radiative transfer, and thermodynamics. One emphasis is monsoon circulations, which deliver water to billions of people living in Asia, Africa, the Americas, and northern Australia; monsoon winds also constitute a major component of the global circulation of Earth’s atmosphere. In our work, we combine theory, observational analyses, and numerical models, paying particular attention to the treatment of phase changes of water, as the interaction of precipitating clouds with planetary-scale flow is one of the central unresolved problems of planetary science.
