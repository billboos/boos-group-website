Global track datasets of monsoon disturbances:

 - [Tracks in 5 atmospheric reanalyses](https://zenodo.org/record/3890646) compiled using an optimized algorithm, as described in [Vishnu et al. (2020)](http://boos.netlify.com/publication/vishnuetal2020)
 - [Older dataset](//worldmonsoons.org/global-monsoon-disturbance-track-dataset) based on ERA-Interim data for 1979-2012, as described in [Hurley and Boos (2015)](http://boos.netlify.com/publication/hurley2015)

[Somali jet index](http://worldmonsoons.org/vjetindex.html), a measure of the strength of the South Asian monsoon circulation, and of roughly 30 percent of the global cross-equatorial flow

[South Asian vertical shear index](http://worldmonsoons.org/WebsterYangIndex.html), the strength of the vertical shear of the zonal wind over South Asian.  This was developed by Webster and Yang (1992, QJRMS) as a measure of the strength of the South Asian monsoon circulation.
 
[Output](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TRPDL6JkcLjgTHJL9Ib_Z4XuPyvNVIyY?usp=sharing) from an idealized quasi-global aquaplanet model run without a convective parameterization (through use of the hypohydrostatic rescaling), from [our paper](https://boos.netlify.com/publication/ogormanetal2020/) that used this model to study the response of extreme precipitation to uniform surface warming.

[Moist energy balance model](https://github.com/hgpeterson/mebm), written in Python by [Henry Peterson](https://climate-dynamics.org/people/hpeterson/) and used in [Peterson and Boos (2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-020-0114-4) to analyze the influence of radiative feedbacks and eddy diffusivity on tropical rainfall shifts.
